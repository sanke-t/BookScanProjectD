# ZXing Android Embedded

Barcode scanning library for Android, using [ZXing][2] for decoding.

The project is loosly based on the [ZXing Android Barcode Scanner application][2], but is not affiliated with the official ZXing project.

Features:

1. Can be used via Intents (little code required).
2. Can be embedded in an Activity, for advanced customization of UI and logic.
3. Scanning can be performed in landscape or portrait mode.
4. Camera is managed in a background thread, for fast startup time.

## Version 3

Where [version 2][4] was essentially just a stripped-down version of the [Barcode Scanner application][2],
version 3 is a rewrite of a large part of the codebase, making it more versatile and customizable.

With the rewrite, many APIs for UI customization were removed. Instead, it is now recommended
to create a custom Activity using the lower-level components directly
(see [Customization](#customization) for details).

Other notable changes:
* The camera is now loaded in a background thread, making the activity start faster.
* The camera preview and decoding now function correctly in any orientation.

## Adding aar dependency with Gradle

From version 3 this is a single library, supporting Gingerbread and later versions of Android
(API level 9+). If you need support for earlier Android versions, use [version 2][4].

Add the following to your build.gradle file:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:3.0.2@aar'
    compile 'com.google.zxing:core:3.2.0'
}
```

## Usage with Maven

Maven is not supported currently, but it is possible that the aar can be used. Pull requests are
welcome.

## Usage with IntentIntegrator

Launch the intent with the default options:
```java
new IntentIntegrator(this).initiateScan(); // `this` is the current Activity
```

Use from a Fragment:
```java
IntentIntegrator.forFragment(this).initiateScan(); // `this` is the current Fragment

// If you're using the support library, use IntentIntegrator.forSupportFragment(this) instead.
```

Customize options:
```java
IntentIntegrator integrator = new IntentIntegrator(this);
integrator.setDesiredBarcodeFormats(IntentIntegrator.ONE_D_CODE_TYPES);
integrator.setPrompt("Scan a barcode");
integrator.setCameraId(0);  // Use a specific camera of the device
integrator.setBeepEnabled(false);
integrator.initiateScan();
```

See [IntentIntegrator][5] for more options.

### Changing the orientation

To change the orientation, create a new Activity extending CaptureActivity, and specify the
orientation in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

Sample:

```java
public class CaptureActivityAnyOrientation extends CaptureActivity {

}
```

```xml
<activity android:name=".CaptureActivityAnyOrientation"
          android:screenOrientation="fullSensor"
          android:stateNotNeeded="true"
          android:theme="@style/zxing_CaptureTheme"
          android:windowSoftInputMode="stateAlwaysHidden">

</activity>
```

```java
IntentIntegrator integrator = new IntentIntegrator(this);
integrator.setCaptureActivity(CaptureActivityAnyOrientation.class);
integrator.setOrientationLocked(false);
integrator.initiateScan();
```

The previous API for `integrator.setOrientation()` was removed. It caused the Activity to be created
in landscape orientation, then destroyed and re-created in the requested orientation, which creates
a bad user experience. The only way around this is to specify the orientation in the manifest.

### Customization

For more control over the UI or scanning behaviour, some components may be used directly:

* BarcodeView: Handles displaying the preview and decoding of the barcodes.
* CompoundBarcodeView: Combines BarcodeView with a viewfinder for feedback, as well as some status /
  prompt text.
* CaptureManager: Manages the InactivityTimer, BeepManager, orientation lock, and returning of the
  barcode result.

These components can be used from any Activity.

Samples:
* [ContinuousCaptureActivity][6]: continuously scan and display results (instead of a once-off scan).
* [ToolbarCaptureActivity][8]: Same as the normal CaptureActivity, but with a Lollipop Toolbar.

## Building locally

    ./gradlew assemble

To deploy the artifacts the your local Maven repository:

    ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

You can then use your local version by specifying in your `build.gradle` file:

    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
